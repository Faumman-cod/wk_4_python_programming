This is a submission of an assignment for week 4 of our Python Programming module week 4.
It showcases the basic understanding of **file handling and exception handling.**

**Examining points are:**
1. **File Read & Write Challenge**🖋️: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.
2. **Error Handling Lab** 🧪: Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if it doesn’t exist or can’t be read.

****Outcomes** **🎉
By the end of this module, you’ll be skilled in managing files efficiently in Python, ensuring error-free code that gracefully handles unexpected issues. Mastering files and exception handling will allow you to build strong, robust applications!
